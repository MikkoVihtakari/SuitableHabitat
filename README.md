# SuitableHabitat
**R package to to estimate habitat spaces for geographic suitable habitat models**

This package is at a very early stage of development and has been placed here for the review-process of a manuscript. At the moment, the package works only for the data used in the manuscript, and not always even for that. Reviewers, please note that the simulations presented in the manuscript have been controlled and checked multiple times. Changing parameters may lead to unexpected results. Anyone else, do not use the package yet.
